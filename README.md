# **CitiBike Travel Time**

## Project Description

Citibike Travel Time will show a Google Maps at a default location. User may input their location and destination to request directions and travel time on a bicycle. Origin and Destination will have Markers on the Map. There will also be an input to locate stations near you.

React Google Maps Style Guide: https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/#introduction

#### MVP
- Consume CitiBike and Google Maps API
- Take input from users (Origin and Target) and query API to calculate best route and travel time.
- Render Stations, Map, Origin, Target, Directions and Travel Time.

#### PostMVP

- Allow user to set favorite/home/work Station(s) 
- Add multiple stops

## React Component Hierarchy

#### Components
 - `<App/>`
 - `<Nav/>`
 - `<Map/>`
 - `<Stations/>`
 - `<Result/>`
 - `<FavoriteStation/>`
 - `<StationList/>`

App will hold all state and will be passed down through props to `<Map />, <Stations />, <Nav />` and `<Result />`.

## Additional Libraries

- `axios`
- `react-google-maps`

## Code Snippet

```
const StationList = (props) => {
  return (
  <section className="station-grid">{
    props.stationList
      .filter(station => (station.latitude > 40.8100))
        .map(station => (
          <article 
            className="card"
            key={station.id}>
            <h3>{station.stationName}</h3>
            <p>{station.availableBikes} bikes available</p>
            <code>id: {station.id} </code>
            <code>lat: {station.latitude.toFixed(4)}</code>
          </article>
        ))}
  </section>
  )
}
```
